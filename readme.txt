============Codecademy Portfolio Project================

This project is to examine if there are factors that can be used to predict if a person will get diabetes.

Factors such as:
- age
- healthy eating
- smoking/drinking 
etc. may give the impression that the risk of diabetes increases with such factors.

The following are the files of relevance in this project:

DATASET:
	diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
	diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
	diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
Of these the middle one [50:50 split] is used in this project.  In this set half of the patients surveyed had diabetes or were pre-diabetic.  
The other half did not have diabetes.

JUPYTER NOTEBOOK:
